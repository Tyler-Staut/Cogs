Before installing the cog I recommend adding your shodan api key otherwise you will have to reload the cog, you can do that with:

```
[p]set api shodan api_key <YOUR_API_KEY>
```

To add this cogs to your instance, run this command first (`[p]` is your bot prefix):

```
[p]repo add red-shodan https://github.com/Tyler-Staut/Red-Shodan
```

Then install the shodan cog:

```
[p]cog install red-shodan shodan_cog
```

If you'd like to contact me, test out my cogs, or stay up to date on my cogs, feel free to reach out!
